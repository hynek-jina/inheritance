/**
 * A serializable representation of an error for safe transfer between execution
 * contexts, such as Web Workers and the main thread.
 *
 * Use this type for unknown (unexpected) errors that need to be transferred
 * across boundaries where native Error objects cannot be sent directly. Not
 * intended for regular (expected) errors.
 *
 * The `error` property contains a plain object with error details, a string, or
 * a fallback value if serialization fails to preserve as much debugging
 * information as possible.
