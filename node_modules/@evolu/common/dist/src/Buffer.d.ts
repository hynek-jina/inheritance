/**
 * A Buffer is a dynamic, resizable container for binary data, optimized for
 * scenarios where the final size is unknown. It grows exponentially (doubling
 * its capacity) to minimize memory reallocations and uses `subarray` for
 * efficient, copy-free data access in methods like `unwrap` and `shift`.
 *
 * ### Recommended Usage
 *
 * Create as few Buffers as possible—typically one main Buffer for the final
 * output. Temporary Buffers are allowed when necessary (e.g., for
 * variable-length headers), but avoid excessive allocations. Buffers can be
 * reused within functions by leveraging `reset` to clear contents while
 * preserving capacity, or `truncate` to adjust the length to a specific size,
 * reducing the need for new allocations. Pass Buffers to `encode*` functions to
 * append serialized data and use `decode*` functions to extract data. Both
 * `shift` and `shiftN` throw an {@link BufferError} with message "Buffer parse
 * ended prematurely" on failure, as do higher-level `decode*` functions,
 * providing stack traces for debugging instead of using {@link Result}. This
 * avoids allocation overhead in success cases and leverages exceptions'
 * diagnostic benefits.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```ts
 * const buffer = createBuffer();
 * encodeNonNegativeInt(buffer, someInt);
 * encodeId(buffer, someId);
 * const result = buffer.unwrap(); // Final serialized data
 *
 * // Decoding example (throws on error)
 * try {
 *   const num = decodeNonNegativeInt(buffer);
 *   const id = decodeId(buffer);
 * } catch (e) {
 *   console.error(e.stack); // Stack trace for debugging
 * }
 * ```
 *
