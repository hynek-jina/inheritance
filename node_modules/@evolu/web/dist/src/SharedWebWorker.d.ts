/**
 * SharedWebWorker (WebWorker + BroadcastChannel + Web Locks)
 *
 * A SharedWebWorker is a Web Worker that is shared across multiple browser
 * tabs. This implementation provides a shared worker-like experience even in
 * browsers that do not support the native SharedWorker API.
 *
 * Unlike a true SharedWorker (which uses MessagePorts for direct, tab-specific
 * communication), this approach uses BroadcastChannel for cross-tab messaging
 * and Web Locks to ensure only one tab owns and runs the actual Worker
 * instance.
 *
 * All tabs communicate via BroadcastChannel, so every message is broadcast to
 * all tabs, and each tab must filter/process only relevant messages. This is
 * less efficient than MessagePorts, but it works everywhere and is "good
 * enough" for most use cases.
 *
 * See the protocol and coordination logic below for details.
 *
 * @module SharedWebWorker
